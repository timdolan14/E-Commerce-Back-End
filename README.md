This application allows developers to thoroughly test the functionality of their API by utilizing Insomnia Core's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. These routes allow for the creation, updating, and deletion of data in the connected database. By leveraging these routes, developers can ensure that the database remains in sync with the changes made through the API and the API is performing effectively.

## Usage
